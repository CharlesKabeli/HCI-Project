# Human Computer Interaction Mini-Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates our application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts, specifically focusing on design principles such as visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency, affordance, and mapping, as well as usability goals.

## Project Description

Our project aims to improve an existing website that provides a Sesotho language learning platform and resources for Sesotho language learners and teachers. We have focused on creating an appealing interface and enhancing the website's responsiveness by adding features such as user accounts and a book borrowing system.

### Main Website
You can visit the main website here: [Sesotho Language Learning Platform](http://sesotho.web.za/)

## Features

- **Appealing Interface**: Redesigned the user interface to be more engaging and user-friendly.
- **User Accounts**: Implemented user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in.
- **Book Borrowing System**: Added a feature for users to borrow books, enhancing the learning experience.
